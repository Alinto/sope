Building
========

If the prerequisites are properly fulfilled, building SOPE 4.5 is
a simple:

  ./configure
  make -s all

(a build takes about 5 minutes on a Debian/Athlon 1.8+)

Installation:

  make -s install


Troubleshooting
===============

* /common.make not found

  If you see errors like "/common.make" not found you either did not configure
  your SOPE tree _or_ you did not source GNUstep.sh

* warning: Foundation/NSObject.h: No such file or directory

  You did not install a Foundation library, eg libFoundation
