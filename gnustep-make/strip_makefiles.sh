# This script "strips" the makefiles and shell scripts.

# By "stripping" a makefile we mean removing all comments, and all
# empty lines.  This reduces considerably the size of makefiles and
# the amount of data that each make invocation has to read; the
# makefiles execute slightly faster.  You shouldn't over-estimate the
# performance issue though - stripped makefiles execute only 5% faster
# on my machine.

# The disadvantage of stripped makefiles is that we remove comments
# and makefiles become almost unreadable.
