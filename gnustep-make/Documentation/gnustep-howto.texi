@chapter Introduction

This document explains how to build the GNUstep core libraries.  The
core libraries, along with associated tools and other files provide
everything necessary for a working GNUstep system. 

In order to easily compile and debug GNUstep projects, you will need the
GNU Objective-C compiler @samp{GCC} as well as various other GNU packages.

You will need at least 80Mb of hard disk space (150Mb prefered) in order
to compile the GNUstep core libraries.  

@node Preliminaries, Compiling and Installing, Introduction, Top
@chapter Summary

In order to compile the libraries, you need to compile and install
the following packages first (if you don't already have them):

@itemize @bullet
@item gcc (Version 2.95 or greater, 3.0.4 or greater recommended)
@item GNU make (Version 3.75 or greater)
@item gdb (Version 6.0 or greater recommended), if you plan to do any debugging
@end itemize

You may also need to install some of the following libraries and
packages described below. Most of these packages are optional, but some
are required.

@table @samp
@item ffcall libraries (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
This is a library that provides stack-frame handling for NSInvocation
and NSConnection. This library is highly recommended. The previous
builtin method for stack frame handling is no longer supported and may
be removed in the future.  ffcall is under GNU GPL. As a special
exception, if used in GNUstep or in derivate works of GNUstep, the
included parts of ffcall are under GNU LGPL.

@item libffi library (ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION)
This is a library that provides stack frame handling for NSInvocation
and NSConnection similar to ffcall. 
Use this instead of ffcall. You don't need both.

@item libxml2 (RECOMMENDED)
The libxml library (Version 2) is used to translate some of the
documentation for GNUstep and to provide suport for MacOS-X compatible
XML-based property-lists. It is not required, but you have to explicitly
disable use of XML when compiling GNUstep base if you do not have it.

@item libxslt (OPTIONAL)
Stylesheet support for use with XML.

@item openssl (OPTIONAL)
The openssl library is used to provide support for https connections by
the NSURL and HSURLHandle classes.  This functionality is
compiled as a separate bundle since the OpenSSL license is not
compatible with GPL, and in the hopes that if someone writes an openssl
replacement, it can quickly be used by creating another bundle.

@item libiconv (OPTIONAL)
Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
You probably don't need it except perhaps on MinGW.
Unicode support functions (iconv) come with glibc version 2.1 or greater. If
you don't have glibc (try iconv --version), you can get the separate 
libiconv library from 
@url{http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-libiconv.html}. However,
neither one is required to use GNUstep.

@item The TIFF library (libtiff) (Version 3.4beta36 or greater) (REQUIRED)
The GUI library uses this to handle loading and saving TIFF images.

@item The JPEG library (libjpeg) (RECOMMENDED)
The GUI library uses this to handle loading JPEG images.

@item The PNG library (libpng) (RECOMMENDED)
The GUI library uses this to handle loading PNG images.

@item gif or ungif (OPTIONAL)
The GUI library uses either one of these libraries to load GIF images.

@item aspell (OPTIONAL)
The GUI library uses this to handle spell checking.

@item cups (OPTIONAL)
The GUI library uses this to handle interface to the CUPS print servers.

@item audiofile (OPTIONAL)
The GUI library uses this for playing sound files.

@item portaudio (OPTIONAL)
The GUI library uses this for the sound server.  Use v19, which has
several API changes since the previous version. v19 hasn't actually been
formally released, but several distributions (SuSE, etc) use it anyway.

@item freetype2 (RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED for art backend)
This is used for font information. Freetype2 cache API is in flux.
GNUstep tries to account for
this, but if you get errors about undefined FTC_ symbols, you might be
using an unsupported version of freetype.

@item libart_lgpl2 (REQUIRED for art backend only)
Drawing library for the art backend.

@item WindowMaker (Version >= 0.62) (OPTIONAL)
GNUstep and WindowMaker work together to provide a consistant interface.
Although it is not required, GNUstep will work much better if you use it
with the WindowMaker window manager. 
Get WindowMaker from @url{http://www.windowmaker.info}.

@item gnustep-objc package (for gcc version < 3.0 ONLY or MINGW/Cygwin) (RECOMMENDED)
Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
You probably don't need it except on MinGW and Cygwin (regardless of the
gcc version you have).
This is a special version of the Objective-C runtime that include several
bug fixes and features that were not in gcc versions previous to 3.0.
It is available at @url{ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/libs} which
compiles using the GNUstep Makefile package (so you don't have to get the
entire gcc dist). Make sure to set the THREADING variable in the GNUmakefile.
It's possible to compile the library static (make shared=no) and
just copy to the place where the gcc libobjc library is (type gcc -v to
get this location). Note you have to install gnustep-make (below) before
installing this library.

@item GDB (OPTIONAL)
GDB can be obtained from @url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb}. As of release
6.0, gdb has special support for debugging Objective-C programs.
    
@item TeX (OPTIONAL)
You need a TeX implementation, like tetex, to compile some of the
documentation (although most of that is available on the web).

@chapter Compiling and Installing the packages

Get the following individual packages:

@itemize @bullet
@item gnustep-make
@item gnustep-base
@item gnustep-gui
@item gnustep-back
@end itemize

See @url{http://www.gnustep.org} for information on where to get these
packages. 

Make sure you install (if necessary) all the previously mentioned
libraries first before configuring and building GNUstep.

You should install these packages as root (read special note for the
gnustep-base library, below, if you cannot do this).

For installation on specific systems, read the machine specific
instructions at the end of this document or appropriate README files in
the gnustep-make Documentation directory (such as README.MingW for Windows).

@node Core Package,  , Compiling and Installing, Compiling and Installing
@section Installing the Core Libraries

The GNUstep packages uses the Autoconf mechanism for
configuration; it checks some host capabilties which are used by
all GNUstep software.  To configure just type:

@example
./configure
@end example

The GNUstep makefile package needs a root directory.  If the
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT environment variable is set then configure will
determine the root directory from its value (by removing the final
/System path component from it).  You can also specify the root 
directory when you run configure with the prefix paramater; the 
following command makes /usr/local/GNUstep the root directory:

@example
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/GNUstep
@end example

If you do not have the GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT environment variable set
and you do not specify a root directory when running configure, then
configure will use /usr/GNUstep as the default root directory.

* Individual Packages::

@node Alternate Library Setup, Individual Packages, Core Package, Core Package
@subsection Alternate Library Setup

Read the installation instructions in the Makefile package (make) for more
installation options. Make sure you use the same
configuration options when configuring each GNUstep library.

@node Individual Packages,  , Alternate Library Setup, Core Package
@subsection Building the Package

To build the individual packages, use this familiar set of commands for
each pacakge (add any additional options you decide upon):

@example
./configure
make
make install
@end example

Start with the Makefile Pacakge (gnustep-make). After installing
gnustep-make you need to execute GNUstep's shell configuration
script, as follows:

@example
 . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
@end example

before proceeding any further. 

NOTE for gcc 2.X or MinGW users: Now install gnustep-objc. Before building
gnustep-objc, edit the @file{GNUmakefile} and set the @var{THREADING}
variable to the thread library used on your system (usually its posix,
but you can leave it at single if you don't need threads). At this point
you should probably re-configure, make and install gnustep-make, so it
can pick up on any threading information that gnustep-objc provides.

Now install gnustep-base, gnustep-gui and finally gnustep-back.

NOTE: If you are trying to install the packages without root permission,
you may need to change one thing in the base library. Edit the file
gnustep-base/Tools/gdomap.h to uncomment the last line and modify
the specified port number to a port which you @emph{know} is not in use on
your network.  You should only do this if absolutely necessary since
making this change will break communications with any systems where
an identical change has not been made.  Also, the standard gdomap port
is the one officially registered with IANA and is reserved for use by
gdomap - it should only be changed if you can't get your system
administrator to start the gdomap server using it.

@end menu

@node Environment Setup, GNUstep Home, Additional Installation, Additional Installation
@section Environment Setup
Add the shell script @file{GNUstep.sh} located in the Makefile
package to your shell startup file (such as @file{.profile}). For instance,
if your GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is @file{/usr/GNUstep/System},

@example
. /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
@end example

in your @file{.profile} file will work (Note the period at the beginning
of the line, and the space between the period and the following path; 
if your GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is different, you need to replace 
@file{/usr/GNUstep/System} with your GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT).
It defines environment variables that are needed to find
GNUstep files and executables.  Users of csh need to use the
@file{GNUstep.csh} script. Read the make package @file{README} for more
info. Some systems, like GNU/Linux have an @file{/etc/profile.d}
directory where scripts can be executed automatically. If you want to
set up GNUstep for every user on your system, you can try
copying/linking the @file{GNUstep.sh} there. For csh or tcsh, try

@example
source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.csh
@end example

@node GNUstep Home, Time Zone, Environment Setup, Additional Installation
@section GNUstep Home

Your home GNUstep directory should be created automatically the first
time you use a GNUstep tool or application.
This is where user defaults are kept as well as
other user configuration files. User installed apps, libraries, etc
are also here (if the default user directory is used). By default this
is the directory @file{GNUstep} under your home directory, but you can change
this (see the gnustep-make installation documentation).

@node Time Zone, GNUstep deamons, GNUstep Home, Additional Installation
@section Time Zone

In most cases, GNUstep should be able to determine your time zone, if
you have already set it up correctly when setting up your
computer. However, in some cases this might fail or the correct
information may not be available.  You can set it manually using the
GNUstep defaults utility to set @kbd{Local Time Zone} to your local time
zone. Type something like @kbd{defaults write NSGlobalDomain "Local
Time Zone" GB}.  Where @kbd{GB} is a time zone abbreviation.

See @file{$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Libraries/Resources/gnustep-bsae/NSTimeZones/zones} for typical time zones):

@node GNUstep deamons,  , Time Zone, Additional Installation
@section GNUstep deamons

Set up your system to execute some GNUstep deamons. If you don't do
this, they will be started automatically when you run your first GNUstep
app:

@itemize @bullet
@item gdomap - Put this in a system startup file, like @file{/etc/rc.local} or @file{/etc/rc.d/rc.local} (customize for your system)
@example
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT=/usr/GNUstep/System
if [ -f $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools/gdomap ]; then
  $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools/gdomap
fi
@end example
@item gdnc - Start after sourcing @file{GNUstep.sh} (e.g. in .profile)
@item gpbs - Same as with gdnc, make sure X-Windows is running.
@item make_services - Not a deamon, but a tool that needs to be run everytime
you install a new Application or service. This is NOT run automatically.
@end itemize

@example
if [ `gdomap -L GDNCServer | grep -c Unable` == 1 ]; then
  echo "Starting GNUstep services..."
  gdnc
  gpbs
fi
make_services
@end example


@node Tools and Applications, Machine Specific, Additional Installation, Top
@chapter Test Tools and Applications

Example applications are located in the gstep-examples package.  To make these,
just uncompress and untar this package, cd to the appropriate
directory, and type make. You will need to install the GNUstep core libraries
first before doing this.

To run the examples. Use the openapp utility that is part of the GNUstep
makefile package (and stored in
@file{$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools}). Usage is:

@example
openapp application [additional arguments to app]
@end example

Good Luck!

@chapter Getting Libraries via SVN

If you didn't get one of the snapshots, or if you want to be sure to
stay on the bleading edge, then you should get the libraries via SVN. Go
to @url{http://www.gnustep.org/resources/sources.html} for information on how
to get the sourcecode.

If you haven't already done so, change to the directory, where you
want the source to reside. To get a list of potential modules to check out,
type
@example
cvs -z3 checkout -c
@end example

For instance, to check our @file{core}, which contains all the GNUstep
code libraries:
@example
cvs -z3 checkout core
@end example

After you have checked out the source you can compile it as
usual. To update the source, go into the directory of the source tree
you want to update, for example, go into 'base', and type:

@example
cvs -z3 update -Pd
@end example

You don't have to re-checkout after you have the source, just update!

\bye
