The currently released version is `1.13.0'.

Changes in version `1.13.0'
===========================

Debug libraries now have the same name as normal libraries (i.e. no "_d"
suffix). This reduces the possiblity of multiple libraries being loaded
into the same executable.

   Added dragonfly OS to make targets.

   Spaces and backslashes are no longer allowed in paths used by the
make package (e.g. with Windows OS). The libraries can still use native
paths.

Changes in version `1.12.0'
===========================

Minor fixes.

Changes in version `1.11.2'
===========================

The `GNUstep.conf' file is now viewed as the essential determination of
the install location for GNUstep libraries, tools and other files.
During configuration, this file is read, if it exists, to determine
this information. This can still be overriden with environment and
command line options, however. See the filesystem documentation in the
GNUstep Make Documentation directory for more information.

   You no longer need to source GNUstep.sh in order to compile GNUstep
programs. All that is needed is the definition of GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES.
You should also have the GNUstep system tools directory in your path.

   All netbsd systems are assumed to use ELF libraries. Support for the
old static libs version of netbsd was removed.

   Serveral new options were added to configure to change the location
of basic dir locations and basic configuration files. Also, the help was
greatly improved. Note that -prefix=/usr/GNUstep/System no longer
works.  Please use -prefix=/usr/GNUstep or
-with-system-root=/usr/GNUstep/System.

   A few more fixes for cygwin are included as well as Windows resource
rules.

   Support for ObjC++ has been added. You should list the ObjC++ .mm
files in the xxx_OBJCC_FILES variable, and put extra ObjC++ flags in
xxx_OBJCCFLAGS or ADDITIONAL_OBJCCFLAGS.

Changes in version `1.11.1'
===========================

Part of the previous change was reversed. Now libobjc is still linked
with individual applications (as well as the base library), since some
operating systems require this to resolve external symbols. However,
there is no need to recompile all applications again.

   Compilation of GNUstep on cygwin was revampled and fixed due to a
lot of work by Tom MacSween.

Changes in version `1.11.0'
===========================

NOTE: The libobjc library is now linked in with the base library and
NOT with individual applications or tools (except on MingW). This
requires that you do a complete rebuild of all libraries, tools and
apps when switching to this new version.

   * New rules for building and using DLLs were implemented. Now gcc
     and other tricks are used to properly export symbols, so no .def
     file should be needed.

   * The GNUsteprc file in $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is deprecated. See the
     new GNUstep.conf file (which is not installed by default).

   * Psuedo-framwork support was implemented on MingW. This essentially
     involves copying the framework to several places so it can be used
     without links, which Windows does not really support.  There's no
     other clean way to do it.

   * Support for xxx_WINDRES_FILES on MinGW was implemented.


Changes in version `1.10.0'
===========================

   * a GNUsteprc file is now automatically created and installed in
     $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT, which sets the system-wide default for the
     user root directory (default=~/GNUstep, which can be overriden
     with the `--with-user-root' argument to configure, or by modifying
     GNUsteprc after configuration.)

   * make_services is not run by GNUstep.sh anymore. You must run this
     manually now (see the gnustep-gui documentation).

   * Palettes use a plist instead of a strings format file now for the
     palette.table file.

   * You can use the `--enable-native-objc-exceptions' argument to
     configure to enable use of built in objc exceptions with compilers
     that support it.

Changes in version `1.9.2'
==========================

   * Application and Bundles use the latest convention on Apple.

   * Improve/Simplify dependency checking when making docs

Changes in version `1.9.1'
==========================

   * Remove `--disable-import' option

   * README.Darwin for darwin/MacOSX install

   * Framework version and naming clarified.

Changes in version `1.9.0'
==========================

   * Support for building in a separate build dir.

   * Add `--enable-strip-makefiles' option to configure

   * List of classes in a framework gets written to the plist file.

Changes in version `1.8.0'
==========================

Read the NEWS file for a complete list of changes since the last stable
release. The major difference from 1.6.0 is that the locations of
certain directories have changed. Generally this will not cause a
problem unless your GNUstep directory is shared by multiple machines
running this and earlier (1.6.x) versions of the software.

Changes in version `1.7.4'
==========================

Bug fixes.

Changes in version `1.7.3'
==========================

   * Adds library combo to Headers directory if not flattened.

   * Add Markup file (Renaissance) support.

Changes in version `1.7.2'
==========================

-enable-flattened (Flat directory structure) is on by default.

   * On WIN32 use HOMEPATH in preference to USERPROFILE

   * netbsd and openbsd compile fixes.

Changes in version `1.7.1'
==========================

Bug fixes.

Changes in version `1.7.0'
==========================

This version contains a major change in the location of certain
directories and installed files as detailed in the `filesystem.texi'
document. When installing this version for the first time, all old
directories and files in those directories will be moved to the new
locations automatically. However, you should update all GNUstep versions
on any machine you have them installed on in order to avoid any
incompatibilities.

   Other changes:

   * Support for preprocessed Info.plists.

Changes in version `1.6.0'
==========================

Make now configures by default for only one system. To compile and run
GNUstep for multiple platforms from the same directory, use the
configure argument -enable-multi-platform.

   * Auto-build def file for DLLs

   * Work natively on MacOSX systems. Now use apple-apple-apple instead
     of nx-nx-nx on OSX systems.

   * More efficient checks for re-making a project.

Changes in version `1.5.1'
==========================

   * Framework support rewritten, also supports multiple names.

   * API change: Replace frameowork's xxx_TOOLS by xxx_COPY_INTO_DIR.

   * Unified link commands between libraries and frameworks
     (LIB_LINK_*).

   * New 'make strings' target for localization support.

   * Speed improvements.

   * Doesn't try to build OSX bundle on GNUstep and vice versa.

   * API change: Tools/Subproj can have resources.

   * API change: TOOL_INSTALL_DIR.

Changes in version `1.5.0'
==========================

   * Add NetBSD Elf support

Changes in version `1.4.0'
==========================

   * Update Darwin/GNU gcc and Irix targets

Changes in version `1.3.4'
==========================

This is a first prerelease version for 1.4.

   * Use gnugc-gnu-gnu library combo for garbage collecting version.

   * Add support for -library-combo in opentool

   * Change GNUSTEP_PATHPREFIX_LIST to	GNUSTEP_PATHLIST

   * Add verbosity levels. Use make messages=yes for full messages.

Changes in version `1.3.3'
==========================

   * Recognizes XXX_STANDARD_INSTALL=no to not do installation.

   * Updated instructions for MingW/MSYS installation.

Changes in version `1.3.2'
==========================

   * Instructions for building on Windows with MSYS

   * Resolve library dependencies better on Windows

   * Fix frameworks in RPMs and DEBs

   * Continued reorganization.

Changes in version `1.3.0'
==========================

The package has gone through an extensive reorganization to break up
each sub-make into two separate components. This allows for much
simplified code and lots of code sharing between components. As a side
effect, it also increased the speed of the code by at least a factor of
2.

   * Force shared=yes for cygwin and mingw

   * Bundles copy resources from subprojects.

   * Better resource management. Resources handled accross all project
     types.

   * Simplified and fixed user root location between make and base
     libraries.

   * Changed Apps directory to Applications

   * Fixes for MacOSX, MingW

Changes in version `1.2.1'
==========================

   * the source distribution code has been rewritten to be more general
     and extended.  Packages built using gnustep-make now automatically
     have handy targets building tarballs from sources or from CVS
     imports.

   * implemented support for auto-dependencies, which means that any
     object file automatically depends on all the header files which
     were used to build it.  Only works with newer compilers.

   * implemented INSTALL_AS_USER and INSTALL_AS_GROUP.

   * implemented a strip=yes option.

   * various bug fixes and minor improvements.

Changes in version `1.2.0'
==========================

   * The core rules and internals of gnustep-make have been
     fundamentally redesigned and rewritten.  notably, gnustep-make now
     works using only a single recursive sub-make invocation rather
     than two, which makes it consistently faster and simpler in all
     circumstances.

   * The clean rules have been heavily optimized - they no longer use
     recursive sub-make invocations at all and so they are really fast.

   * Many improvements to java support. Optimized management of nested
     classes

   * Better conformance to make conventions.

   * File specific compilation flags

   * Fixed darwin support

   * Support for C++ files.

   * Made use of library installation dir consistent with other
     installation.

   * Much improved Windows path support

Changes in version `1.0.1'
==========================

   * Support for Java tools.

   * Build GUI backend as a bundle (default).

   * Remove backend part of LIBRARY_COMBO.

   * Fixes to run on FreeBSD, Solaris.

Changes in version `1.0.0'
==========================

   * Optimizations that in many cases more than double the speed.

   * Added preliminary darwin support.

   * rpm packeing improvements.

   * Better checking for mingw and cygwin

Changes in version `0.9.2'
==========================

   * HOWTO and faq files moved from core package to here

   * Configurable GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT and GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT

Changes in version `0.9.1'
==========================

Make has been reoganized so that it only relies on libraries and other
things that are necessary for the Makefile package itself. Any
libraries wanting to add extra package information can do so by
installing a make stub in the `Additional' directory. This greatly
simplifies compilation and packaging.

   * Javadoc support added.

   * debian directory added for dpkg

   * RPM support rewritten from scratch.

Changes in version `0.9.0'
==========================

ffcall library is highly recommended for use with the GNUstep base
library. You need to have installed it prior to configuring the Makefile
package. See the INSTALL file.

   * Support for automatically generating RPM spec files.

   * Build suitable files for MacOS bundles

   * Add option for flattened directory structure.

   * LaText documentation support.

   * Added support for Frameworks

Noteworthy changes in version `0.6.6'
=====================================

The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system root
directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep root
directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old behavior
using a configure option `--without-system-root'. We also recommend
removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the new one in
order to avoid problems with the system finding the correct binary
and/or library.

   * Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
     and usage.

   * Java support rewritten and extended.
