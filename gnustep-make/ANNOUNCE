Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.13.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

Changes in version `1.13.0'
===========================

Debug libraries now have the same name as normal libraries (i.e. no "_d"
suffix). This reduces the possiblity of multiple libraries being loaded
into the same executable.

   Added dragonfly OS to make targets.

   Spaces and backslashes are no longer allowed in paths used by the
make package (e.g. with Windows OS). The libraries can still use native
paths.

Obtaining gnustep-make
======================

You can get the gstep-make-1.13.0.tar.gz distribution file at
