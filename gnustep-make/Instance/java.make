#
# You can compile any set of java classes, it does not need to be strictly 
# a single package in the java sense.  Please put a single class in each 
# source file.  Multiple classes in a single source file are not supported.
#
# The name of the Java package is in the JAVA_PACKAGE_NAME variable.
# The java files to be compiled are in the xxx_JAVA_FILES variable;
# they should be specified in full relative path, such as: 
# test_JAVA_FILES = gnu/gnustep/base/NSArray.java
#
# The relative path is important because things will be installed 
# in $(JAVA_INSTALL_DIR)/{relative_path}; for example, 
# the file above would be installed in 
# ${JAVA_INSTALL_DIR)/gnu/gnustep/base/NSArray.class
#
# JAVA_INSTALL_DIR contains the directory where you want to
# install your classes - it defaults to $(GNUSTEP_JAVA), which is
# $(GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT)/Library/Libraries/Java/.
#
# If you have all your files in a directory but want them to be
# installed with a different relative path, you can simply redefine 
# JAVA_INSTALL_DIR, as in the following example - 
# JAVA_INSTALL_DIR = $(GNUSTEP_JAVA)/gnu/gnustep/base/
#
# If you have java sources to be processed throught JAVAH to create
# JNI headers, specify the files in xxx_JAVA_JNI_FILES.  The headers
# will be placed together with the source file (example: the header of
# gnu/gnustep/base/NSObject.java will be created as
# gnu/gnustep/base/NSObject.h) These headers are not installed.
#
# If you have properties file to install, put them in the
# xxx_JAVA_PROPERTIES_FILES
