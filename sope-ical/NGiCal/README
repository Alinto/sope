Objective-C classes for representing iCalendar entities as objects. To
actually parse iCalendar entities the sope-xml versitSaxDriver is used.
Note that this library doesn't make any use of the now deprecated libical but
rather relies on the SAX interface (SaxObjectDecoder is used).

Recurrences
===========

Recurrences are modeled via iCalRecurrenceRules and an iCalRecurrenceCalculator
which contains all the necessary logic according to RFC2445 to interpret
iCalRecurrenceRules. The calculator needs a referrence date for the first
instance of a recurrence which is usually provided by any of the repeatable
entity objects (i.e. iCalEvent).

Please note that recurrences are work in progress and far from being
complete/compliant with RFC2445. So far only the most simple cases are done
properly.
