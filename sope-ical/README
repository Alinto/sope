Last change: 2004-10-17

This package currently contains three things:

a) iCalSaxDriver   - a SaxObjC SAX driver based on libical
   => DEPRECATED
b) versitSaxDriver - a SaxObjC SAX driver for parsing vCard and iCal files
c) NGiCal          - a set of classes representing iCal entities

The iCalSaxDriver is deprecated in favor of the versitSaxDriver which does
not have the dependency on libical but implements the parsing on its own.


To test the SAX driver, you can use the saxxml tool, eg:

  saxxml -XMLReader VSiCalSaxDriver data/test-noodle1.ics 

This will print the tags reported to the SAX handler.
