2006-05-02  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* SOPEXAppController.m: added config for WOHttpTransactionLogger -
	  transactions now properly do appear in the console window (v2.0.9)

2006-01-27  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v2.0.8

	* SOPEXBrowserController.m: added UI delegate methods for creating
	  new browser windows. It's possible now to have multiple targets
	  in a SOPE:X application.

	* SOPEXWebConnection.[hm]: exposed -localResourceBundle and reworked
	  discovery of application prefix.

	* NSBundle+Ext.m: minor bugfix

2005-09-28  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* SOPEXContentValidator.h: added missing @class declarations (v2.0.7)

2005-09-20  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* GNUmakefile.preamble: added include dirs for inline compilation
	  (v2.0.6)

2005-09-18  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* GNUmakefile.preamble: added linking path/dependency to NGMail
	  (v2.0.5)

2005-08-17  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* GNUmakefile.preamble: fixed install-dir (/Library/Frameworks)
	  (v2.0.4)

2005-08-16  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* v2.0.3

	* added framework GNUmakefile

	* SOPEXWebConnection.h: added missing NSMutableDictionary prototype

	* SOPEXSheetRunner.m: include required AppKit.h

	* SOPEXSheetRunner.h: added missing NSWindow prototype

	* SOPEXContentValidator.m: added missing prototypes, include NSError.h
	  for NSLocalizedDescriptionKey

	* SOPEXConsoleEventFormatter.m: fixed a gcc 4.0 warning

	* SOPEXAppController.m: include NGObjWeb.h for missing symbols

	* SOPEXConsole.h: added NGLogEvent class forward declaration

2005-01-04  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* SOPEXAppController.m: changed default handling in -prepareForLaunch
	  to be more applicable to the changed conditions. It would probably
	  be best to have a search list, but AFAIK Apple removed this from
	  NSUserDefaults ... sigh. (v2.0.2)

2005-01-03  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v2.0.1

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: applications start on arbitrary port now.
	  This is managed by some "convenience" insight into WOApplication.
	  Applications are also restartable now - this might help debugging
	  a bit. When the last browser window was closed, other windows are
	  closed automatically - this means the app will terminate then
	  (even in RAD mode).

	* SOPEXBrowserController.m: notify SOPEXAppController of controller
	  shutdown during window close.

	* SOPEXConsole.[hm]: new API to close console programmatically and
	  to ask whether it is visible currently - this is used by
	  SOPEXAppController to automatically close the console when it's the
	  last interesting window around.

	* SOPEXStatisticsController.[hm]: same as in SOPEXConsole (s.a.)

2004-11-23  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v2.0.0

	* CHANGES: new file providing an overview of the architectural changes
	  between 1.x and 2.x in form of an overview

	* TODO: new file

	* SOPEXBrowserController.[hm]: new controller responsible for managing
	  the contents of a WebView. For each "target" window in an application
	  a new controller is created and assigned. NOTE: there's a major
	  bug that causes the controller's to be released at the end of a
	  load. The reason for the bug is still unclear, but it's something
	  that is caused by WebKit (by its resource loading delegate
	  mechanism). As long as this isn't fixed, the -release method is
	  overwritten to do nothing.

	* English.lproj/SOPEXBrowserController.nib: accompanying NIB for the
	  SOPEXBrowserController

	* SOPEXConsoleAppender.m: new appender for the SOPEXConsole

	* SOPEXConsoleEventFormatter.m: special event formatter, providing
	  required formatting for the SOPEXConsole

	* SOPEXConsole.[hm]: basically rewritten, doesn't work on file handles
	  any more but instead uses its own SOPEXConsoleAppender to receive
	  log output.

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: substantially rewritten. SOPEXAppController
	  only cares for stuff happening on an app level (setup, connecting to
	  the SOPE thread, notifications). All other stuff (WebKit) is handled
	  by SOPEXBrowserController now.

	* SOPEX_Prefix.pch: renamed - is common.h now

	* SOPEXSNSController.[hm]: removed, obsoleted due to technical changes

	* SOPEXApplication.[hm]: removed, obsoleted due to technical changes

	* English.lproj/SOPEXMainMenu.nib: removed, this is part of a new
	  project's template now.

	* *.m: major code cleanup, reformatting.
	
	* *.h: proper safeguarding headers against double inclusion.

2004-06-05  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.9

	* SOPEX.h: exports nearly all headers now, suitable for real AppKit
	  apps constructed from a SOPE:X app that need to subclass from
	  SOPE:X classes

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: exposed -(BOOL)isInRADMode and added
	  - (void)appendToDaemonLaunchArguments:(NSMutableArray *)_args; for
	  subclassers to append custom launch arguments to the daemon
	  process.

	* SOPEX.xcode: modified visibility of most headers to be public instead
	  of project.

2004-05-02  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.8

	* Version: changed to 1.0.8. Added comment for MacOSX explaining
	  /Developer/Tools/agvtool to set version on MacOSX properly.

	* *.[hm]: changed all relevant #include statements into #import
	  statements, as #import now officially has been undeprecated from
	  FSF gcc.

	* NSBundle+Ext.[hm]: New category on NSBundle to ease resource lookup
	  in SOPE:X.

	* English.lproj/Localizable.strings: English localization template,
	  sporting fancy unicode characters.

	* SOPEXAppController.m: rewrote some document management code which now
	  defaults to better integration with SoApplication based apps. Also
	  rewrote bundle handling - properly works now in development and
	  deployment modes.

	* SOPEXWebConnection.m: fixed resource lookup. Uses NSBundle+Ext now.

	* SOPEX_Prefix.pch: redefined NSLocalizedString macro in a way it works
	  with SOPE:X out of the box.

	* SOPEXBrowserWindow.m: experimental support for setting the favicon
	  in the window's title bar similar to NSDocumentController managed
	  applications. However, this support is questionable in itself and
	  I'm probably dropping it altogether in an upcoming release. The code
	  is currently left as an exercise only.

2004-04-09  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.7

	* SOPEXContentValidator.[hm]: New (concrete) class implementing all
	  necessary validation for SOPE:X. The WOHTML validation could be a
	  bit smarter, though.

	* SOPEXWODocument.m: Implemented validation.

	* SOPEXWOXDocument.m: Implemented validation.

	* SOPEXDocument.[hm]: Removed SOPEXDocumentErrorDomain declaration.

	* SOPEXTextView.m: Fixed -adjustStatusField.

	* README: Updated TODO section

2004-04-01  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.6

	* SOPEXSheetRunner.[hm]: Cover for running sheets in a synchronous way,
	  similar to NSRunAlertPanel() - but only for sheets.

	* SOPEXTextView.[hm]: Subclass of NSTextView being able to indicate
	  errors via auxiliary NSTextField.

	* SOPEXDocument.[hm]: Documents are now the delegates of the TextViews
	  representing the documents, thus appropriate functionality is
	  provided by SOPEXDocument as of now (selection management,
	  undoManager, etc.). Also, implemented the validation API.

	* SOPEXWODocument.m: Added code for selection management.

	* SOPEXWOXDocument.[hm]: Added code for selection management, also
	  added some validation code (just for testing purposes).sudo 

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: Added code for properly discovering RAD
	  mode - will now remove certain functionality when in deployment.
	  Removed code dealing with change management (now in SOPEXDocument),
	  implemented new validation API. Also, added alert sheets when
	  unsaved changes are about to be discarded. This does work correctly
	  now.

	* README: Updated TODO section

2004-03-26  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.5

	* Introduced a new document architecture. Instead of subclassing from
	  NSDocument, this is written from scratch. The NSDocument
	  architecture does something different (though not completely) than
	  what we needed here, so this is pretty much specialised on our
	  needs. I felt that NSDocument didn't fit in too well - also, it
	  felt rather oversized for our purpose. I didn't want to introduce
	  window controllers since we really don't have a need for that.

	* SOPEXDocument.[hm]: Abstract superclass for documents in SOPEX.

	* SOPEXWOXDocument.[hm]: A .wox document wrapper. Please note that
	  encoding is done wrong here! This needs to be addressed in a later
	  version. For the time being, NSUTF8StringEncoding is assumed as
	  the default encoding.

	* SOPEXWODocument.[hm]: A .wo document wrapper. Encoding is also
	  broken, see SOPEXWOXDocument comment.

	* SOPEXRangeUtilities.[hm]: Functions for intelligently handling
	  selections in NSTextViews. Intelligently for the time being means
	  selecting to matching HTML tags (yes!). However, this is still
	  incomplete and the algorithm is more or less optimized for speed
	  than for formal correctness - however it works pretty well in
	  real life szenarios (famous last words ;-).

	* SOPEXBrowserWindow.[hm]: Toyed a bit with setting the favIcon into
	  the window's title bar, but haven't found out how to do that
	  correctly, yet.

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: Changed to use the new document
	  architecture.
	  Added revertDocumentToSaved: and editInXcode:
	  Added delegate code for proper selection handling, uses
	  SOPEXRangeUtilities (no surprise here).

2004-03-22  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.4

	* README: Explained some debugging issues.

	* SOPEXWebConnection.[hm]: Fixed resource loading issue. Images are
	  now (correctly) loaded by the wrapper app. This directly results in
	  much better throughput/performance.

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: Added WOPort default, see README for usage.
	  Added several new views. User visible changes are a new HTTP header
	  view and source views for .wox and .wo components. The source
	  views aren't complete, yet.

	* SOPEXSNSController.m: Added SNSPort default, see README for usage.

	* SOPEXBrowserWindow.[hm]: New NSWindow subclass, SHOULD add some
	  fancy extensions in the near future.

	* NSString+Ext.[hm]: Extensions that later might go into SxCore.

	* WebView+Ext.[hm]: Extensions to WebView from WebKit.


2004-03-11  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.3

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: added Source view. Fast switching
	  between application and source view possible via Apple-1 and Apple-2.

2004-03-10  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.2

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: added status bar with some nifty infos,
	  removed toolbar due to some very strange problems (toggle toolbar
	  in "Tools" menu to see what I mean). Added "Navigation" menu for
	  browser navigation support. Also added "View" menu which is intended
	  for switching between different views (source code, structure, etc.).
	  The general idea is to have an integrated editor somewhen.

	* SOPEXToolbarController.[hm]: added caching of items as proposed in
	  Apple's dox and implemented selectableItems.

	* SOPEXApplication.m: moved loading of Main NIB from -(id)init
	  to -(void)finishLaunching in order to avoid problems with certain
	  widgets' initialization methods.

2004-03-09  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* v1.0.1

	* SOPEXAppController.[hm]: Cosmetic changes, clear: console support

	* SOPEXConsole.toolbar: Toolbar definition for console

	* SOPEXConsole.[hm]: Added clear: functionality, utilizes toolbar

2004-02-27  Helge Hess  <helge.hess@opengroupware.org>

	* SOPEXAppController.m: disabled some logs

	* SOPEXMain.m: properly use ".sopex" instead of "sopex" in the
	  bundle suffix

	* SOPEXWebUI.toolbar: removed some unnecessary things

2004-02-16  Marcus Mueller  <znek@mulle-kybernetik.com>

	* ChangeLog: created.
