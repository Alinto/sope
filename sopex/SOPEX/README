ABSTRACT
========

SOPEX provides basic infrastructure for developing SOPE applications
using Xcode on Mac OS X. SOPEX consists of a framework, a project
template and several file templates. The SOPEX.framework provides functionality 
for launching and debugging SOPE applications. SOPEX applications can be 
launched as normal Desktop applications and provide their own, integrated web 
browser (using Apple's WebKit). Doing so, SOPEX applications are fully 
functional stand-alone HTML applications.


PREREQUISITES
=============

SOPEX depends on SOPE being installed. Please read the accompanied
documentation for details.


DEBUGGING
=========

Unlike in 1.x, SOPEX 2.x applications are single process which means you can
debug them using gdb (in Xcode or using the command line) as any other project.


USEFUL DEBUGGING DEFAULTS
=========================

At present there's a limited set of NSUserDefaults aiding in the debugging
of SOPEX applications. Please note that all user defaults for SOPE applications
will work as well.

-WOPort <number>:
 if set, forces the child process to be launched on this specific port.
 Useful for debugging with tcpdump.
                      
-SOPEXDebugEnabled <bool>:
 Global debug message trigger.

-SOPEXDebugWebConnection <bool>:
 Use this to trigger debug messages in SOPEXWebConnection.

Prebinding Notes
================

General technical information about prebinding is available from Apple at
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/LaunchTime/Tasks/Prebinding.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001858.

OGo frameworks currently use the range from 0xC0000000 to 0xCFFFFFFF.

Any questions and feedback regarding our use of this range should go to
