CHANGES BETWEEN 1.x and 2.x:
----------------------------

SOPE:X 2.x has been redesigned to be single process. SOPE:X 2.x is threaded
now, the main thread being AppKit related and the second thread being
responsible for running NGObjWeb's WORunLoop.

Because of this, SNS has been removed from SOPE:X. Also, the SOPEXConsole has
been rewritten from using pipes to utilizing a new SOPEXConsoleAppender (and
related formatter). This is limited to NGLogging, however. NSLog() won't
work in this context - however NGLogging is supposed to be the new standard
and is supported throughout SOPE.

The MainMenu.nib is no longer located in the SOPE:X framework, it's a resource
of the main bundle now. This leads to much easier customization for those who
need it.
