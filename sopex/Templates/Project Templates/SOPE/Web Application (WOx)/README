Rapid Development
=================

In order for "Rapid Development" to work properly you need to open
Xcode's "Project" menu and select "Edit active executable"
(Apple-Option-X). In the following dialog navigate to the "General"
section (in previous versions of Xcode this was called "Runtime") and
select the "Project Directory" as the working directory when launching
the executable.
