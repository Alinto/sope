Templates
=========

XCode project template and several file templates.


INSTALLATION
============

There are two places where you can install the templates contained
in this directory:

1) /Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/
2) ~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/

Templates installed in 1) are available for all developers working
on this machine. Templates installed in 2) are available for you,
only.

NOTE: installing templates means to copy them - there's no other magic
involved, no need to compile anything etc. Simply copy them to one of the two
destinations above. I usually do a
find . -type d -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;
afterwards in order to remove the Subversion metadata. This metadata would
get copied to the new projects destination otherwise, probably causing
confusion if you plan on using Subversion in your projects.

Whether you copy the templates with 'cp' or 'gnutar' is up to you, there are
no special files involved.
