PlistSaxDriver
==============

This directory contains the sources for a SAX driver bundle which can read
"old-style" property list files. It reports the parsing events in the XML
format of "new-style" XML property-list.

This one is experimental and more a technology demo than a practical 
application ! Feel free to extend it and submit changes ;-)
