pyxSAXDriver
============

This directory contains the sources for a SAX driver bundle which can read
so called "pyx" files. PYX is a line based representation for XML useful for
processing XML files using Unix cmdline tools (like grep or awk).

The parser itself is written in Objective-C (and probably pretty slow for
large files ;-)
