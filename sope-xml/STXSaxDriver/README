Note: this is the initial release, it should contain some bugs ;-)

STXSaxDriver
============

This project contains a skyrix-xml/SaxObjC SAX driver bundle which can process
so called "structured text" files, or in short "STX". The parsing events are
reported as XHTML tags.

Example:
---snip---
* item A

* item B
---snap---
will be reported as SAX events similiar to such an HTML file:
---snip---
<ul>
  <li>item A</li>
  <li>item B</li>
</ul>
---snap---

The basis for this driver bundle, the StructuredText framework, was initially
written by Mirko Viviani and Giulio Cesare Solaroli and sponsored by eXtrapola
Srl.
Note that the "original" StructuredText framework is much more capable and 
generic than what this SAX driver provides. On the pro side, your applications
do not need to care about the actual tag format if you use SaxObjC. Your
applications can use either, XHTML, HTML, PYX or STX files using the available
SaxObjC drivers without any additional work.

Supported MIME Types
====================

Not sure what the correct MIME type for structured text is supposed to be, for
now we register this driver for the

  "text/structured"

MIME type.

How to try
==========

Just use the saxxml or domxml tools which are part of skyrix-xml, eg:
  
  saxxml -XMLReader STXSaxDriver data/hhtest1.stx
  
This will print the XHTML representation of the STX file on stdout.

STX Functionality which is implemented
======================================

Anyway, we used this document as "reference":

  http://plone.org/documentation/howto/FrontPage/UsingStructuredText

of the construct defined there, we have skipped just the table construct.

But we have added a few thinks:
- it is possible to use quotes in link url (es: if you have 
  "Link":http://www.url.com, the comma will end up into the link; to avoid 
  this, we can parse a string like that: "Link":'http://www.url.com', and the 
  comma will be left out of the link).
- link target: they are not a first class citizen (specially in XHTML), but 
  sometime they are very usefull. To define a target, you can add it after a 
  link: "Link":'http://www.url.com'::'target'. Also the target can be quoted 
  in order to avoid problems with punctuation.
- Image link: in order to create a link around an image, we have defined the 
  following sintax: 
    ["Alt text":http://www.url.com/image.gif]:'http://www.url.com'. 
  Here too, quoting and target are supported.
