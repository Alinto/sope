TODO
====

- add SAX wrapper for Parsifal ?
  http://www.saunalahti.fi/~samiuus/toni/xmlproc/

- add a DOM builder which can create a DOM from a libxml2 or
  CoreFoundation DOM tree instead of using SAX
  (should be much more efficient)

- write a SAX driver based on NSXMLParser (should be an almost trivial 1:1
  mapping)
