sope (4.3.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove iCalSaxdriver (and thus the dependency on libical) in favour of
    versitSaxDriver.
  * Remove standard configuration files for mod_ngobjweb. Such things belong
    to a setup of a SOPE site and not in mod_ngobjweb's default configuration.

sope (4.3.8-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. Upstream did some heavy source restructuring,
    resulting in a greatly reduced number of source packages for SOPE and
    OpenGroupware.org. At the same time SOPE and OpenGroupware.org will now be
    treated different projects, since SOPE can be useful without OGo as well.
  * A new versioning scheme has been applied to the new sources. Versions with an
    odd number as second component denote unstable development versions.
    Neither API nor ABI stability may be ensured in this version. Versions
    with an even second component are the stable releases.
  * SOPE now installs to FHS compliant paths.
