  This is parser can be used to parse simple SQL statements. It's not a full
  SQL implementation, but should be sufficient for simple applications.

  Additional hints:
  - the selected attributes are added to the 'attributes' hint, if a
    wildcard select is used (*), the hint is not set
  - the depth of WebDAV scope from-queries are set in the depth-hint, valid
    values are "deep", "flat", "flat+self", "self"
  - if multiple entities are queried in the FROM, they are joined using ","
    and set as the entityName of the fetch spec
