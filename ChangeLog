	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(-generateDataForHeaderFieldNamed:value:): fixed a bug where the
	buffer was treated as an unicode buffer (right) but where bytes
	were extracted as an UTF-8 string (wrong). The "obj" variable is
	now named "address" as a more explicit name.

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(NGEncodeQuotedPrintableMime): we encode ' ' as '_'.

	sope-core/NGStreams/NGActiveSSLSocket.m,
	sope-core/NGStreams/NGSocket.m
	Added TLS support for IMAP4 clients.
