2010-08-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* NGExtensions/NSMethodSignature+misc.[hm]: dropped useless and
	cumbersome category module.

2010-08-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* NGBundleManager.m (+load): removed method.
	(+defaultBundleManager): removed the hack with the objective-c
	class load hook since it uses memory and slows SOPE down for
	nothing.
	(_addMainBundlePathToPathArray:): we now ignore empty paths, since
	we actually don't want to scan the CWD for bundles.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/SNSConnection.m: removed obsolete class.

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(-generateDataForHeaderFieldNamed:value:): fixed a bug where the
	buffer was treated as an unicode buffer (right) but where bytes
	were extracted as an UTF-8 string (wrong). The "obj" variable is
	now named "address" as a more explicit name.

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(NGEncodeQuotedPrintableMime): we encode ' ' as '_'.

2010-08-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Client.m,
	sope-core/NGStreams/NGActiveSSLSocket.m,
	sope-core/NGStreams/NGSocket.m
	Added TLS support for IMAP4 clients.

2010-08-12  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Dropped the sope-tools debian package and
	all references to it

2010-07-29  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Initial import of the SOPE source based on
	the r1664 revision.
	* Added the sope-patchset and the sope-gsmake2 patches
	* Added the sope-debian patch
	* Dropped a bunch of useless stuff
