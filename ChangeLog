2011-11-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOMessage.m (-init): set version to
	"HTTP/1.1" instead of "...1.0".

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOResponse.m (-init): set version to
	"HTTP/1.1" instead of "...1.0".

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WebDAV/SoWebDAVRenderer.m
	(-stringForValue:ofProperty:prefixes:requireTagValue:): don't
	append a space to singletons tags as html clients from the 90's
	are no longer used for anything serious nowadays.

2011-11-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOHttpAdaptor/WOHttpTransaction.m
	(-deliverResponse:toRequest:onStream:): capitalize header names if
	"WOHTTPAdaptorCapitalizeHeaders" is set.
	(-_reasonForStatus:): improved certain "reasons" for picky clients.

2011-11-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-gdl1/PostgreSQL/NSString+PGVal.m
	(stringValueForPostgreSQLType:attribute:): we don't need to escape
	"\" with postgres.

2011-10-31  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Connection.m
	(-fetchContentOfBodyPart:atURL:withPeek:): new method that enables
	the use of either "BODY" or "BODY.PEEK" as body part prefixes.

2011-10-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeMultipartBody.m (-initWithPart:): removed
	useless constraint on the _part parameter, since it's not even
	used.

2011-10-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMail/NGMimeMessage.m (-initWithHeader:): invoke
	"retain" rather than copy on the header hashmap, in order to
	enable further modifications in the client code.

2011-09-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Connection.m: made
	imap4FolderNameForURL: and imap4FolderNameForURL:removeFileName:
	public.

2011-09-04  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-core/NGStreams/NGActiveSocket.m
	(-_unixWriteBytes:count:) - we tell send()
	to not emit any signal such as SIGPIPE. This cause
	havoc in OpenChange if the remote peer closes the
	socket for inactivity.

2011-07-29  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added patch from http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=1390
	  to add GNU TLS support.

2011-07-27  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Dropped useless stuff in SOPE
	* Made sure everything would compile and work
	  on GCC's runtime (< 4.6 and >= 4.6) and the
	  GNUstep runtime (libobjc2-1.5). This is an initial effort
	  as things should still be cleaned up in SOPE.

2011-07-18  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* NGUrlFormCoder.m (NGDecodeUrlFormParameters): applied a patch from
	bug #1369 which fixes a buffer overflow.

2011-07-06  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m
	(-_parseSearchResponseIntoHashMap:) we make sure
	that we've got a MSN before adding it to the 
	array of MSNs. This can happen when servers
	just return "* SEARCH" with no MSN.

2011-07-05  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m
	Applied a patch from bug #1358 which fixes
	ACLs for names containing spaces.

2011-06-29  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGSieveClient.{h,m}: Implemented
	correctly the PLAIN authentication to support proxying

2011-04-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-core/NGExtensions/FdExt.subproj/NSString+URLEscaping.m
	(-containsURLInvalidCharacters): we wander the string as an array
	of utf8 bytes, replacing the previous method that wrongfully
	casted "unichar" into "char" data, leading to false negatives
	for certain characters.
	(-stringByEscapingURL): simplified and fixed method, that
	wrongfully used the generic "-cStringXXX" methods. From now on,
	the string is converted to an NSData, and the encoding is either
	latin-1 or utf-8 based on doUseUTF8Encoding().

2011-04-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Connection.m (-doesMailboxExistAtURL:):
	if the mailbox is already counted as selected by the NGImap4Client
	instance, we return YES directly to avoid a costly UIDVALIDITY
	operation.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOHttpAdaptor/WOHttpAdaptor.m
	(+iniitialize): we no longer make use of "WOHttpAllowHost".
	(-_accept): included remote address verification code from
	_checkAccessOnConnection:
	(-_checkAccessOnConnection:): removed obsolete method.

2011-04-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/Defaults.plist: WOHttpAllowHost now set
	to an empty array.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOWatchDogApplicationMain.m
	(-_listeningAddress): don't warn about WOHttpAllowHost when its
	value is an empty array.

2011-03-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-core/NGStreams/configure: updated config.guess and
	config.sub in order to support more modern architectures. Removed
	useless creation of arch-dependent subdirs containing config.h.

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m (_parseSingleBody): be
	even more tolerant with responses from dbmail.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/DynamicElements/DynamicElements/WOString.m
	(-[_WOSimpleStaticString initWithValue:escapeHTML:]): perform
	string manipulations on an array of unichar instead of using the
	"cString" methods, which return a wrong number of bytes in a non
	8bit environments.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/WOWatchDogApplicationMain.m
	(-[WOWatchDogChild readMessage]):
	don't set the watchdog timeout if watchDogRequestTimeout is less
	than 1.
	(-[WOWatchDogChild _safetyBeltIteration:]): renamed from
	"_killKill" and made a multi-iteration callback. Warns the user
	each minute about request still hanging. Kills the child once
	watchDogRequestTimeout has been reached for "killTimerIteration".
	When occurring from a child, display a warning and invalidate the
	faulty timer, although this should never occur.
	(-[WOWatchDog _spawnChild:]): make all children release their kill
	timer as they will otherwise be retained and their timer will be
	triggered. This fixes a bug that was introduced in the last
	change where children would attempt to kill one another.
	(WOWatchDogApplicationMain): invoke "applicationWillStart" on the
	WOApplication class when available, in order to let it perform
	initialization tasks after the user defaults and the logging
	channels have been setup propertly.

2011-03-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeType.m (classForType): accept
	"text/vcard" type.

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m (_parseSingleBody): be
	tolerant for mail servers that don't separate the response member
	with a space character (like dbmail): don't use consumeIfMatch,
	which raises an exception if the requested char is not found.

2011-03-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m (_purifyQuotedString):
	fixed to accept spaces between quoted and unquoted chunks (bug
	#723).

	* sope-core/NGExtensions/NGQuotedPrintableCoding.m
	(NGDecodeQuotedPrintableX): be tolerant for certain mailers that
	define the final line as a folded one...

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Connection.m (-fetchContentOfBodyPart):
	wander through the whole list of responses since the requested
	body part might be returned after one or more untagged responses.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWEb/WOWatchDogApplicationMain.m
	(-[WOWatchDogChild terminate]): no longer release the control
	socket from here as the child's signal handle will try to notify
	us that it is terminating. The control socket is released later in
	-handleProcessStatus.
	(-[WOWatchDog _cleanupSignalHandlers]): no longer release the control sockets
	from here as the excessive children will be released fully when
	releasing the children accounting arrays.
	(-[WOWatchDog _spawnChild]): the children accounting arrays are
	released and the current child is retained so that the excessive
	control sockets, watchdog timers and memory are all removed from
	memory.

2011-02-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMail/NGImap4Connection.m (-selectFolder:): compare
	folder names in their utf-7 form.

2011-02-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * sope-mime/NGMail/NGSmtpClient.m
	Removed the Bcc stripping code as it's now
	done within SOGo.

2011-01-05  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-core/NGExtensions/NGQuotedPrintableCoding.m
	Applied a patch from Marcel Waldvogel
	Marcel.Waldvogel@uni-konstanz.de which fixes
	bug #1009.

2010-12-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/EOQualifier+IMAPAdditions.m
	(-[EOKeyValueQualifier
	imap4OperatorForDateKeyword:andComparisonSelector:]): consider
	the EOQualifierOperatorGreaterThanOrEqualTo and
	EOQualifierOperatorLessThanOrEqualTo operators.
	(-[EOKeyValueQualifier appendToImap4SearchString:insertNot:]): Use
	a minimalist english locale for generating date description to
	avoid taking the active locale into account. The locale is
	generated from the new function below.
	Consider the EOQualifierOperatorCaseInsensitiveLike operator where
	appropriate.
	(initDateLocale): new function that generates a minimalist english
	locale with the "NSShortMonthNameArray" key/value.

2010-12-17  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeRFC822DateHeaderFieldParser.m
	Fixed a braindead error where the data lenght was
	verified after the strdup() call when it was equal
	to 0 - generating a segfault in rare occasions.

2010-11-10  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Client.m
	If we use Courier, we now avoid using UTF-8
	SORT as it's a compile-time option not that common
	This can be nonetheless forced using the
	ImapSortEncoding.

2010-11-02  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeHeaderFieldGeneratorSet.m
	We no longer use NGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator
	for in-reply-to fields as they aren't "email addresses"
	but rather "message ids".

2010-11-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-json/SBJSon/: Inclusion of Stig Brautaset's SBJson library.

2010-10-08  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Client.m
	We "assume" the server returns us UIDs sorted
	by date when we only ask for this. This is the
	case for GMail and Courier and makes initial mail
	loading much faster
	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m
	Fixed a _consume(self, 1); in _parseEnvelopeAddressStructures
	when _parseEnvelopeAddressStructure returns nil in order
	to consume the space.

2010-09-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4ResponseParser.m
	We now try harder to get a string out of
	an encoded string by trying the supplied encoding,
	trying next UTF-8 and finally giving up with
	ISO-8859-1.

2010-08-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeRFC822DateHeaderFieldParser.m
	(parseTimeZone): we must use signed types for time units to avoid
	a sign-bit "overflow".

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/Associations/WOKeyPathAssociation.m:
	enhanced to support the "long long" fundamental type.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/DynamicElements/_WOStaticHTMLElement.m,

	int" for compatibility with versions of GNUstep base >= 1.20.

	* NGExtensions/NSMethodSignature+misc.[hm]: dropped useless and
	cumbersome category module.

2010-08-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* NGBundleManager.m (+load): removed method.
	(+defaultBundleManager): removed the hack with the objective-c
	class load hook since it uses memory and slows SOPE down for
	nothing.
	(_addMainBundlePathToPathArray:): we now ignore empty paths, since
	we actually don't want to scan the CWD for bundles.

	* sope-appserver/NGObjWeb/SNSConnection.m: removed obsolete class.

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(-generateDataForHeaderFieldNamed:value:): fixed a bug where the
	buffer was treated as an unicode buffer (right) but where bytes
	were extracted as an UTF-8 string (wrong). The "obj" variable is
	now named "address" as a more explicit name.

	* sope-mime/NGMime/NGMimeHeaderFieldGenerator.m
	(NGEncodeQuotedPrintableMime): we encode ' ' as '_'.

2010-08-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* sope-mime/NGImap4/NGImap4Client.m,
	sope-core/NGStreams/NGActiveSSLSocket.m,
	sope-core/NGStreams/NGSocket.m
	Added TLS support for IMAP4 clients.

2010-08-12  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Dropped the sope-tools debian package and
	all references to it

2010-07-29  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Initial import of the SOPE source based on
	the r1664 revision.
	* Added the sope-patchset and the sope-gsmake2 patches
	* Added the sope-debian patch
	* Dropped a bunch of useless stuff
