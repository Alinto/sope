ExpatSaxDriver
==============

This directory contains the sources for a SAX driver bundle which works on top
of the Expat XML processing library.

NOTE: this driver is outdated now, hence it's in the recycler. I
revived it for some test against the libxmlSAXDriver which nevertheless
showed that expat consumes way less memory and seems to be much faster
when parsing "large" (in my case a 9MB XML plist) XML files than
libxml2.
