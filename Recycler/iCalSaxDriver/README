iCalSaxDriver
=============

IMPORTANT: iCalSaxDriver is considered DEPRECATED. SOPE/OGo now uses the
           versitSaxDriver as its iCalendar parser.

Overview
========

An SaxObjC driver for iCalendar files. It basically maps iCal 2.0
components, properties and paraemters to the XML events according to
the xCal 02 draft (iCal 3.0).

Having a SAX driver for iCal might seem strange and a bit inefficient at
first look, but the time saved for the application-level developer is
significant, since he only needs to learn (or usually already knows) the
SAX or DOM APIs and any XML API based on them (like XPATH, XQUERY).

ToDo
====

The driver is by no means complete or 100% compliant to xCal (which
isn't final anyway ...). So:
- improve error handling (SaxExceptions !)
- make the driver fully xCal compliant
- recurrence rules !!!
- implement all components supported by libical
- make it as fast as possible ;-) (probably most gains can be made by
  improving DOM, not iCalSaxDriver ...)

Examples
========

To "convert" an iCalendar to xCal (the test programs print out some XML):

  saxxml -XMLReader iCalSaxDriver test1.ics
  domxml -XMLReader iCalSaxDriver -xml  test1.ics

To "convert" an iCalendar to PYX:

  domxml -XMLReader iCalSaxDriver -pyx  test1.ics
