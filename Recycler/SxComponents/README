This implements the client interfaces to a SandStorm like
XML-RPC based component system.

Auth-Handling
=============
If you make a call which requires authentication, a somewhat
complex process is initiated ... ;-)
This is to be described here ...

Failover
========
The components support some kind of 'transparent application failover'.
When a daemon crashes, it gets restarted by the skymasterd, but on
a new port as the ports are assigned by the kernel. When the component
can't connect to the server anymore, cause it only knows the old port
the server ran on before it crashed, it queries the new data from the
registry and runs the method on the server with the new IP and port.
The retry count and the time between the retries can be handled with
the defaults described below. If it can't connect within the retry count
given, the exception is passed as result (which can then be handled by the
UI). 

Defaults
========
  
  SxComponentRegistryBackends - ( SxXmlRpcRegBackend )
  SxComponentRegistryURL      - "http://127.0.0.1:14042/RPC2"

  SxComponentRetriesOnError   - how many retries should be run
                                when the component couldn't connect
                                to the server (Default: 3)

  SxComponentRetryTime        - how long should be waited between
                                the retries - this one gets multiplied
                                with the retry count, so the first retry
                                is run immediately, the second after
                                1*retryTime, the third after 2*retryTime etc.
                                (Default: 5)
