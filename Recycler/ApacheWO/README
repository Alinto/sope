How to start
============

First you need to tweek httpd.conf to reflect you pathes ...
Important: you probably need to *install* the bundle before it works,
Apache doesn't search for the bundle in the current directory ...

The easiest way to start it is to invoke:

# httpd -X -f $PWD/httpd.conf

The -X option starts Apache in single-process mode (no children are
forked) and the -f specifies the local server config file. Note that
the server config file needs to be specified as an absolute path.
