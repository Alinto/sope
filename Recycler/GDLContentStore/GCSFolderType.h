  GCSFolderType

  This is the "model" of a folder, it specifies what quick attributes are
  available, in which tables it is stored and how it is retrieved.
  
  For now, we only support one 'quick' table (we might want to have multiple
  ones in the future).
  
  Note: using the 'folderQualifier' we are actually prepared for 'multiple
        folders in a single table' setups. So in case we want to go that
        route later, we can still do it :-)
