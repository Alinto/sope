NGObjDOM XML Rendering Framework
================================

Note: while NGObjDOM *is* useful it is more or less deprecated in the places
      where it is currently used, which are: OGo forms and OGo publisher.
      In both cases the NGObjDOM implementation of the templates should be
      replaced using NGObjWeb XML DOM builders for a major speedup and far
      better integration into the NGObjWeb server.

NGObjDOM is a framework which works together with NGObjWeb to render
XML content represented as DOM trees.
It can be used to create templates (WODynamicElement's) represented
as XML files instead of .wo components.

To render a DOM tree you can use the WORenderDOM dynamic element, eg:

  <#DOMContent />

  DOMContent: WORenderDOM {
    domDocument = domTree;
    factory     = passThroughHTMLRenderer;
  }

The DOM is processed using so called 'node renderers', which are roughly
identical to WODynamicElements but differ in that they only perform the
operation and do not represent the template tree (WODynamic elements are
tree nodes with behaviour, this is separated in NGObjDOM: the tree is the
DOM, the behaviour are the renderers).

The superclass for all node renderers is ODNodeRenderer and already provides
some convinience methods for accessing attributes and such. The ODR class
prefix stands in for 'ObjDOM Renderer'.

A bridge to dynamic elements in the other direction (embedding 
WODynamicElement's in DOM trees) is the ODRWebObject renderer.

Profiling
=========

You can profile the renderer using the defaults

  ODProfileRenderer    - bool
and
  ODProfileRendererMin - double

Defaults
========

  ODNodeRendererDebugCursor - bool

ODProfileRenderer - Bool - log render profiling information

ODNodeRenderer Debug Defaults
  ODEvalAttrValuesInExceptionHandler - bool
  ODDebugJSAttrEval - bool
  ODLogAttrValues   - bool
