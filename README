mod_ngobjweb
============

An Apache module for forwarding HTTP request from Apache to a SOPE
application server. This is a non-streaming proxy so that the application
server isn't blocked by IO of slow connections!
(this eliminates the need for threading because of IO, the Apache server
 pool runs the blocking IO operations)
