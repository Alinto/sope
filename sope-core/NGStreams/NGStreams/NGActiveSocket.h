/*
  Represents an active STREAM socket based on the standard Unix sockets
  library.

  An active socket can be either a socket gained by calling accept with an
  passive socket or by explicitly connecting one to an address (a client
  socket).
  Therefore an active socket has two addresses, the local and the remote one.

  There are three methods to perform a close, this is rooted in the fact that
  a socket actually is full-duplex, it provides a send and a receive channel.
  The stream-mode is updated according to what channels are open/closed.
  Initially the socket is full-duplex and you cannot reopen a channel that was
  shutdown. If you have shutdown both channels the socket can be considered
  closed.
