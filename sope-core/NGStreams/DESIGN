DESIGN
======

This library was roughly designed after the Java IO package. Additionally it
fully supports Unix socket abstractions (domains, addresses and sockets).

Some ObjC design decisions:
- do not throw exceptions (but keep them in -lastException)
- use protocols
- support streaming operation
