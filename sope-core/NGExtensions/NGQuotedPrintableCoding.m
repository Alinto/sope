  6.7. Quoted-Printable Content-Transfer-Encoding

  ...

  In this encoding, octets are to be represented as determined by the
  following rules:


    (1)   (General 8bit representation) Any octet, except a CR or
          LF that is part of a CRLF line break of the canonical
          (standard) form of the data being encoded, may be
          represented by an "=" followed by a two digit
          hexadecimal representation of the octet's value.  The
          digits of the hexadecimal alphabet, for this purpose,
          are "0123456789ABCDEF".  Uppercase letters must be
          used; lowercase letters are not allowed.  Thus, for
          example, the decimal value 12 (US-ASCII form feed) can
          be represented by "=0C", and the decimal value 61 (US-
          ASCII EQUAL SIGN) can be represented by "=3D".  This
          rule must be followed except when the following rules
          allow an alternative encoding.

    (2)   (Literal representation) Octets with decimal values of
          33 through 60 inclusive, and 62 through 126, inclusive,
          MAY be represented as the US-ASCII characters which
          correspond to those octets (EXCLAMATION POINT through
          LESS THAN, and GREATER THAN through TILDE,
          respectively).

    (3)   (White Space) Octets with values of 9 and 32 MAY be
          represented as US-ASCII TAB (HT) and SPACE characters,
          respectively, but MUST NOT be so represented at the end
          of an encoded line. Any TAB (HT) or SPACE characters on an
          encoded line MUST thus be followed on that line by a printable
          character. In particular, an "=" at the end of an encoded line,
          indicating a soft line break (see rule #5) may follow one or
          more TAB (HT) or SPACE characters. It follows that an octet
          with decimal value 9 or 32 appearing at the end of an encoded line
          must be represented according to Rule #1. This rule is necessary
          because some MTAs (Message Transport Agents, programs which transport
          messages from one user to another, or perform a portion of such
          transfers) are known to pad lines of text with SPACEs, and others
          are known to remove "white space" characters from the end of a line.
          Therefore, when decoding a Quoted-Printable body, any trailing white
          space on a line must be deleted, as it will necessarily have been
          added by intermediate transport agents.


    (4)   (Line Breaks) A line break in a text body, represented
          as a CRLF sequence in the text canonical form, must be
          represented by a (RFC 822) line break, which is also a
          CRLF sequence, in the Quoted-Printable encoding.  Since
          the canonical representation of media types other than
          text do not generally include the representation of
          line breaks as CRLF sequences, no hard line breaks
          (i.e. line breaks that are intended to be meaningful
          and to be displayed to the user) can occur in the
          quoted-printable encoding of such types.  Sequences
          like "=0D", "=0A", "=0A=0D" and "=0D=0A" will routinely
          appear in non-text data represented in quoted-
          printable, of course.

    (5)   (Soft Line Breaks) The Quoted-Printable encoding
          REQUIRES that encoded lines be no more than 76
          characters long.  If longer lines are to be encoded
          with the Quoted-Printable encoding, "soft" line breaks
          must be used.  An equal sign as the last character on a
          encoded line indicates such a non-significant ("soft")
          line break in the encoded text.
