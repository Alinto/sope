NGLogging OVERVIEW
==================

TBD: write overview!


NOTES
=====

NGLoggerManager:
- provide some extra config for configuration of appenders for loggers

NGLogger:
- what about loggingPrefix?
- provide API for setting appenders

NSObject+ExtendedLogging:
- should check if -loggingPrefix is defined. If YES should provide this to
  logger

NGLogEvent
- should remember its logger? -> probably important for filtering


APPENDER NOTES
==============

- We're probably not interested in providing lots of appenders for lots of
  different loggers. Most of the time we have something like a default
  appender, say NGLogConsoleAppender during development and NGLogSyslogAppender
  for deployment (or file appenders)
