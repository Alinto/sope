Changes in version 1.0.0 since version 0.9.0:

* The focus of this version is a bug-free and stable code base, only
  few new features were added, but a *lot* of bugs were fixed and some
  important performance improvements were added. 1.0 can be considered
  production quality.

* Support for some new Cocoa classes, like NSURL

* Improved compatibility with gstep-base

* more and fixed timezone files

* support for read-only strings in UTF-8 and UTF-16

* some fixes for warnings thrown in new gcc (gcc3+) compilers



Changes in version 0.9.0 since version 0.8.0:

* The most important change is the support for Boehm's conservative
  garbage collector, that makes the memory management much more easier
  than the reference counting mechanism. Many thanks to Helge Hess
  <helge@mdlink.de> for persuading me to implement this facility and
  also for his support.

* Some portions of the code have been optimized to gain speed: objects
  that were previously allocated in some functions or methods at each
  invocation have been allocated once per-thread.

* The library has been ported to PowerPC running AIX 4.1.5. The port is
  complete, it also includes the NSInvocation and NSMethodSignature
  classes. Many thanks to Steven Besler <sbesler@exchange.ml.com> and
  Leon Salvail <lsalvail@global-village.net> for supporting this work.

* Added support for dynamically loading bundles when running in the
  GNUstep environment.

* The documentation is now written in Texinfo and we documented almost
  all of the additional features libFoundation comes with in addition
  to the OPENSTEP implementation.

* Bug fixes in several classes, including NSArray, NSString and
  UnixSignalHandler.



Changes in version 0.8.0 since version 0.7.1:

* The library has been made thread-safe; much of the work has been done by 
  Aleksandr Savostyanov <sav@conextions.com>.

* New classes NSFileHandle, NSHost, NSPipe and NSTask have been added. These
  classes are new in the OPENSTEP 4.x and Rhapsody implementation from
  NeXT/Apple.

* A new class UnixSignalHandler which provides an object oriented approach
  for dealing with the Unix signals. The class works with both BSD and System V
  ways of handling signals and allows messages to be sent both immediately
  after the signal has been received or after the run loop finishes the current
  loop.

* The library was partially ported over to Alpha machines running Linux. The
  code is 64-bit clean but I still need to finish the NSInvocation and
  NSMethodSignature Alpha dependent macros. The library was also ported to
  Intel/Solaris 2.5.1.

* A new program for managing the defaults database system was added. It works
  much like the defaults program under OPENSTEP 4.x. You can also compile it
  for other implementations of the Foundation library since it does not use
  any features specific to libFoundation.

* NSNotificationQueue has been integrated with the NSRunLoop class. You can now
  use the various ways of posting notifications as described by the
  documentation of this class.

* The testsuite was ported to work with the Foundation on OPENSTEP 4.x using
  the native compiler. Thus we have an easy way to ensure the compatibility of
  various OpenStep Foundation library implementations. We have split the
  test suite in two parts: a general library and some scripts that are
  general enough so they can be also used by other libraries to write DejaGnu
  test for Objective-C programs and the test suite itself, specific for the
  Foundation library. In order to compile and run the tests you should have to
  install the GNUstep makefile package first and then the objc-test library.
  If you're using it for other libraries than libFoundation you should also
  get and compile the FoundationExtensions library.

* The library has been ported over to the GNUstep makefile package so one can
  use libFoundation as a Foundation library in GNUstep applications (support
  for libFoundation is already included in the makefile package).

* Bug fixes and improvements in a lot of classes.



Changes in version 0.7.1 since version 0.7:

* The port to Solaris has been completed thanks to Aleksandr Savostyanov
  <sav@conextions.com>.

* libFoundation was ported to Windows NT; thanks to Jeremy R. Bettis
  <jeremy@hksys.com>.

* Shared library support has been added. New makefile targets exist on systems
  that support shared libraries (`shared' and `install_shared'). The currently
  supported systems are Linux ELF, Solaris and OPENSTEP 4.x.

* NSRunLoop and NSPosixFileDescriptor classes has been finished. The NSRunLoop
  API has been changed to work with NSPosixFileDescriptor objects instead of
  Unix file descriptors.

* Delayed execution of methods in NSObject is now working.

* The library now works with both 960906 and 960318 Objective-C runtime
  patches. (You must have either one of these patches applied to the compiler
  before compiling libFoundation; see the INSTALL file for more info.)

* Many bug fixes and improvements in NSInvocation, NSTimer, exception handling
  without nested functions support, NSString, geometry functions,
  NSDistributedLock, NSFileManager and NSRunLoop. See the ChangeLog file for a
  complete list of the changes.
