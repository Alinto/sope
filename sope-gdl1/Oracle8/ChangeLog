	* OracleValues.m (-stringValueForOracleType:attribute:): boolean
	values are now converted to 0 or 1.

2010-03-31  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OracleAdaptorChannel.m (+initialize): set the prefetch memory
	size from a new "OracleAdaptorPrefetchMemorySize" userdefault. Use
	"16 * 1024" by default.
	(-evaluateExpression:): make use of the new prefetchMemorySize
	variable to configure the OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_MEMORY on the
	statement. We also set OCI_ATTR_PREFETCH_ROWS to an unreasonably
	high number to ensure the memory size always has precedence.
