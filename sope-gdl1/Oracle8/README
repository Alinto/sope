Oracle 10g GDL Adaptor
Copyright (c) 2007  Inverse groupe conseil inc. and Ludovic Marcotte
====================================================================

This adaptor allows you to use an Oracle 10g (or above/below) server togeter
with GDL. It makes use of the new OCI API from Oracle. In order to compile
and use this adaptor, you must install the Oracle Instant Client.

For Linux-based operating systems, please refer to the following page
for installation instructions:

http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/linuxsoft.html

You'll have to install the following packages from Oracle:

 * oracle-instantclient-basic
 * oracle-instantclient-devel

Once you've installed the requirements, follow the installation and configuration
instructions to get the adaptor working.


Installation and Configuration
==============================

1- Based on where you've installed the Oracle dependancies, modify the
   GNUmakefile so gnustep-make can find the location of Oracle's headers
   and client librairies. You would want to modify at least:

   ORACLE_VERSION
   -lnnz

2- Compile and install the adaptor:
   % make
   % make install 


Testing the Oracle Adaptor
==========================

The adaptor comes with a simple testing tool called 'otest'.

To try it, first modify the database connection parameters specified in the
'condict.plist' file.

Then, simply run the tool:

% ./obj/otest

This will do a simple "SELECT * FROM all_tables"


Current limitations
===================

The adaptor currently supports only the following data types:

 - CLOB
 - DATE
 - INTEGER
 - NUMBER
 - STRING
 - VARCHAR2

CLOB are read as strings.

The adaptor does not yet support the EOModel kungfu. The following
improvements are also coming soon:

 - primary key generation support
 - schema selection support
 - delegate calls, when required
 - more datatypes support
