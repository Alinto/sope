    <h4>Embedding Components</h4>
    <p>
      You can embed components using the usual WOX "&lt;var:component&gt;"
      tag. As usual subcomponents are looked up using the master components
      WOResourceManager which in turn will usually perform a SOPE lookup
      to find the component.
    </p>
    
    <table border="1" bgcolor="#EFEFEF">
      <tr><th>Embed</th></tr>
      <tr><td><var:component className="embed.wox"/></td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <h4>Querying Images</h4>
    <p>
      You should access images using the "src" attribute, but you can
      query them using "filename". So what is the difference ? 
      <br/>
      Images selected using "filename" delay the resolution of the
      query to the runtime. They construct a URI like "component/image.gif",
      so the component will be asked during the actual image query. The
      component then will locate the image using it's WOResourceManager.
      <br />
      In contrast, images selected using "src" defer the selection to the
      browser, that is, the browser will calculate the image path based on
      it's query URL. Of course the URL calculated by the client can still
      be dynamic !
    </p>
    <p>
      accept.gif via filename: <img filename="accept.gif"/> 
      <br/>
      accept.gif via src: <img src="accept.gif"/>
    </p>
