Todo's for SOPE OFS

- distinguish between WebMethods and WebDocuments !!! WebMethods operate
  on the 'clientObject' while WebDocuments operate on themselves (eg
  /a/b.wox - if b.wox is a method, the clientObject is 'a')

- currently OFSImage/OFSFile "GET" returns a WOResponse, it should return 
  itself and the SOPE rendering step should morph the OFSImage into a 
  WOResponse, this way we are much more flexible in handling (eg a renderer
  could convert or compress an image on the fly)
  [DONE?]

- autodetect "special" versioned folders based on ".svn" and "CVS", this
  should be supported in the core to trigger categories based on that ?
  [DONE?]

- add some caching logic, eg a "cached" filemanager which wraps an 
  NGFileManager (remember, SOPE objects itself should be controller !)

- OFSImage/OFSFile (or their renderer) should properly deliver the last
  modified and etag HTTP headers

- add MIME-type mapping to OFSFile/OFSImage using /etc/mime.types

- store permissions of objects in folders (special file ?)
  - acquire object permissions from parent folders ?

- a "property storage" object for abstracting where OFS properties are
  stored:
  - in a plist file
  - in Subversion
  - in ...
  The property storage should not be fixed on the OFS SoClass !

- add support for Zope Page Template syntax (create a WOxElementBuilder for
  the tal: namespace)

- add a dynamic element for "rendering" HTTP headers, eg:
  <http:header name="content-type" value="text/xml+svg" />

- add an XSLT method using libxml2

- add a PHP OFS method
  - how to apply templates ? 
  - internal redirect ?

- add support for "source.html", like in Zope
  - edit raw source of a document
