SOPE WebDAV Todos
=================

- implement move

- Proper handling of "If:" headers, WebDAV RFC 2518, 9.4.2
  ---
  If: <http://www.foo.bar/resource1> (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>
   [W/"A weak ETag"]) (["strong ETag"])
   <http://www.bar.bar/random>(["another strong ETag"])
  ---
  Syntax seems to be:

   <URL> (lock [etag]) ([etag2])

  a url embedded in <>, then a set of () surrounded options which contain
  some XML and optionally an etag.

  Eg this is submitted by Cadaver for locking requests.
