TODO
====

- find out what the OOo WebDAV properties are supposed to do

- TOO MUCH duplicate code for URL processing ...

- add a hack for redirecting "/" to "/$bundleName" in case the default
  request handler is WOComponentRequestHandler or WODirectActionRequestHandler

- add an HTML compatibility mode to the dynamic elements to support WO pages
  which start with:
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

- implement WOMultipartIterator like in WO 5.3, would be useful for the
  WOSimpleHTTPParser
  - also: WOMultipartIterator.WOFormData

Man Pages
=========

Checking for correctness:
  nroff -mandoc  -Tascii sope-ngobjweb-defaults.5 > /dev/null


Dynamic Elements
================
- none missing?
- WOActiveImage

WOx
===
- bind 

XML-RPC
=======
- add timeout capability to NGXmlRpcClient


Ivars
=====
currently stored in extended attributes or userInfo:
- WORequest:
  - WORequestStartDate           [done: startDate]
  - WORequestStartProcStatistics [done: startStatistics]
- WOComponent:
  - _ODCycleCtx (used for cursor) [done] TODO: isn't that a WOContext ivar?
    => needs to be documented and explained first
  - component definition during init (currently wosVariables)
- WOContext
  - SoRootURL      [done: rootURL]
  - SoObjPermCache [done: objectPermissionCache]
- WOMessage
  - WODOMContent (cache for -contentAsDOMDocument) [done: domCache]

Misc
====

- WebScript, maybe using StepTalk?
  => SOPE 5.0

- catch requests to /favicon.ico

- watchdog does restart child even on a clean termination ?

MacOSX port
===========

- really hackish use of COCOA_Foundation_LIBRARY to distinguish
  whether we are compiling for the GNUstep environment or not

WOMessage / WOResponse
======================

- support streaming (prepared)

- queue append calls instead of processing them in-place
  - use WOProfileResponse for profiling
  - avg:     ~1500 str calls, ~250 char/cstr, ~300 HTML
  - regular: ~5000 str calls, ~2000 char, ~1200 HTML
  - hopefully we could gain major performance benefits by doing bulk
    charset=> data conversions?
